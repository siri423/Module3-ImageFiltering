## Image blurring by filtering: spatial domain vs Fourier domain

A small web app that blurs an image using a filtering approach (convolution with
a blur kernel, written by hand) and then shows the Convolution Theorem in action:
blurring in the spatial domain gives the same result as multiplying the Fourier
transforms in the frequency domain.

## Where each assignment requirement is covered

| Requirement | Where |
|---|---|
| Blur an image (filtering approach) | `src/spatial.py` and the web app tab "1. Blur an image" |
| Spatial filtering equals the Fourier equivalent | `src/frequency.py`, `src/compare.py` and tab "2. Spatial = Frequency" |
| Convolution in space equals multiplication in frequency | tab "2. Spatial = Frequency" and tab "3. Theory" |
| Theory and derivation | `Module3_Report.pdf` (Sections 3 and 4) and tab "3. Theory" |
| Working demo as a web application | `app.py` (Streamlit) |

```

## Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the web app (this is what the screen recording shows)
```
streamlit run app.py
```
Then open the address it prints (usually http://localhost:8501) and go through
the tabs:

1. Overview: what the app does and the link to the GitHub repo.
2. Blur an image: upload a picture or use the built in sample, pick a kernel
   (box or Gaussian) and a size, and see it blurred. There is a checkbox to
   process in color if you want.
3. Spatial = Frequency: the same image is blurred both ways and the app reports
   the biggest difference (around 1e-15, so they are the same), with a side by
   side view and the frequency spectra.
4. Theory: the Convolution Theorem written out.

## Run from the command line (optional, reproduces the figures)
```
python -m src.compare --kind gaussian --size 15
python -m src.compare --kind box --size 9
```
Example output:
```
max abs diff   : 2.665e-15      spatial and frequency results are the same
MSE            : 2.226e-31
PSNR (dB)      : 306.5
```

## How it works in short
A blur kernel (box or Gaussian, built in `kernels.py`) is a small grid of weights
that add up to 1. Blurring convolves the image with that kernel. `spatial.py` does
this directly with a convolution I wrote by hand, no library blur function.
`frequency.py` does the same job in the Fourier domain: it takes the FFT of the
image and the kernel, multiplies them, and transforms back, because convolution in
space is the same as multiplication in frequency. `compare.py` runs both on the
same input and measures the gap, which sits around 1e-15, so the theorem holds.

## Requirements
Python 3.9 or newer, plus streamlit, numpy, pillow and matplotlib (see
`requirements.txt`).
